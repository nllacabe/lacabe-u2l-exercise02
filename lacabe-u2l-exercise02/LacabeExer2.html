            <p>My name is Nicole Lacabe, but most people call me Nicks. I was born on June 12, 2004, and I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os. I've always been drawn to the world of technology, fascinated by its endless possibilities and ability to shape our future. Alongside my academic journey, I have a profound love for makeup and fashion. The artistry and creativity of these industries captivate me, and I dream of combining my technical skills with my passion for aesthetics. In the future, I aspire to work in makeup and fashion, leveraging technology to innovate and push boundaries as a woman in the technology field.
